For my project I was thinking of using the Ames House dataset (http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf), to make a machine learning model that could predict the sale price of houses. The program would basically have three phases, the 1st would be cleaning up the dataset (filling in missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, feature extraction, feature selection,  etc). The 2nd step would involve creating some form of Regression Model and training it on the dataset. I would use cross validation to see how accurate it is, and then perhaps tune the hyperparameters with gridsearch. I was thinking of using some examples from the textbook such as Random_Forest Regression, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression,etc. The last step would be to make predictions on the test set and see how will it performs. As a bonus, I was also thinking of creating some ensemble model that takes the predictions of 3 other models and takes the average, to see if that would perform better than the models themselves.
